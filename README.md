# functionalBST
An implementation of BST in C++. Made with functional paradigm. 

It's a solution to 7th exercise from JNP1 (in fact C++ classes) at MIM UW (University of Warsaw).

# Files

bst\_imp.h is a file with final solution (it is written in .h file because it makes use of templates).\\
bst.h is a file with definition of BST class. It was given by our Tutor to specify some details of implementation.
my\_bst\_test.cpp is a file with tests.
sample\_bst\_usage.cpp is a file which was given by our Tutor to do some simple tests of our implementation.
